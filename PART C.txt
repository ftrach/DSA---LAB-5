PART C: ANALYSIS OF SORTED LINKED LIST OPERATIONS



1 . INSERT(SELF, DATA)

   - TRAVERSES UP TO N NODES TO FIND THE CORRECT POSITION

   - TIME COMPLEXITY : O(N)



2 . REMOVE(SELF, DATA)

   - SEARCHES FOR THE TARGET NODE AND UPDATES POINTERS IF FOUND

   - TIME COMPLEXITY : O(N)



3 . IS_PRESENT(SELF, DATA)

   - LINEAR SEARCH FOR THE VALUE IN THE LIST

   - TIME COMPLEXITY : O(N)



4. __LEN__(SELF)

   - RETURNS THE COUNT VARIABLE DIRECTLY

   - TIME COMPLEXITY: O(1)



SUMMARY :

ALL OPERATIONS EXCEPT __LEN__ ARE O(N) DUE TO POTENTIAL TRAVERSAL OF THE LIST. 

__LEN__ IS O(1) BECAUSE THE NODE COUNT IS STORED  .
